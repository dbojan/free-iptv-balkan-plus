On android, if you want to download file, click and hold, and save file. Or paste m3u url directly in player.

EPG

"Kodi simple iptv client" only supports one epg url at the time. Only one is enabled in the list.

ProgTV can add more than one epg sources, you have to add each in the single text box for guide, when adding sources, then click update button.

List URLS can be found [here](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg), shorter versions [here](short)
