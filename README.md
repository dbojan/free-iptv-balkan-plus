### How to use it:

### Windows:

I use editor [csvEdit_Esmeralda](https://github.com/dbojan/csvEdit_Esmeralda) to open m3u list, and then double click on row to view channel.
Requires [mpv](https://mpv.io/) player and ffmpeg to be installed, preferrably in d:\apps.

List of usable media players: 
- [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) start vlc, media/open network stream, add https://cutt.ly/bppp
- [ip-tv player by BorPas-Soft](https://borpas.info/iptvplayer) supports epg, windows only, freeware
  - to set user agent in windows, in 'IpTvPlayer.User.ini' file, under [Settings] add: 
   - setvlcvars="http-user-agent=Android"
- [SF Vip player](https://serbianforum.org/threads/sf-vip-plejer.878393/)
  - to add playlist, click on ... on the right, then +user.
  - Enter name (anything), location (local file or internet address), and user agent (anything, for example mpv)
  - epg support server-enabled only.
- [smplayer](https://www.smplayer.info/), download m3u file, open file, no support for epg
- [progtv player](https://www.progdvb.com/index/progtv/progtv-win) (shareware, minor limitations, like no recording), win, android, ios
- [mpc-hc version by clsid2](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc/), file, open file-url, add long url. Not supported: short url, user agent, epg
- [kodi](https://kodi.tv/): install simple iptv plugin, add address: https://cutt.ly/bppp. Complicated to setup
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/), command line mostly.


### Android/TV
- sparkle tv, very good, supports encrypted channels, supports auto refresh with 3 hours minimal time. Can only add one playlist at a time, 
- ott navigator, supports encrypted channels, DOES NOT support auto refresh in free version, can add multiple playlist, one active at a time.
- progtv, 3 seconds delay at a start in trial version, supports auto refres with 1 hour minimal time, multiple lists support, one active at a time I think.
- [progtv player](https://www.progdvb.com/index/progtv/progtv-win) settings
  - add sources: https://cutt.ly/bppp includes english channnels, or https://cutt.ly/bddd (domaca)
  - use **arrow up** or **arrow down** on the remote to move through channels
  - if there is no channel after wake from sleep mode, press **ok** on remote a couple of times, or go up/down channel while wifi is restored
   - Recommended settings: **User interface**/more options/show confirmation on exit=off
    - show information after selecting channel from the list=on
   - **Controls** / Start program after boot=on
    - close list after selecting channel=on
    - cyclic=on (on the Last channel, when you press down key, program will go back to channel 1)

 - [orion tv android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rs.maketv.orionott), rotating list of free regional channels
   - install [DNS66](https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66), to block adds
   - set dns66 to autostart, add [adguard](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/general/dns-providers/) dns ip: 94.140.14.14, or 94.140.14.15 (optional?)
   - recommend to use orion app as a guest, you get more channels?
   - after starting orion app, press ok on the remote, use **channel+** and **channel-** to move through channels

- tivimate: paying required for: resume last channel, autostart, update list from app, more than one list. Not recommended.  Supports encrypted channels
- kodi does not support encrypted channels?, big
- mpv and vlc players are also available for android.


###  EPG (Electronic Program Guide), tv schedule

- Note: epg currently it is not added directly to these list, cause I did not use it much, and I think it uses a lot of memory on Android TV.
- [ip-tv player by BorPas-Soft](https://borpas.info/iptvplayer), windows only, supports multi epg, add it in app settings (CTRL+P).
Separate url to epg xml with comma: http://www.something.com/epg1.xml,http://http://www.something.com/epg2.xml
Right click on app, select 'TV Guide', 'Update TV Guide'
- [kodi](https://kodi.tv/) only supports one epg url at the time. 
- ProgTV can add more than one epg sources, you have to add each in the single text box for guide, 
when adding sources, then click update button.

Epg xml addresses examples:
- https://i.mjh.nz/PlutoTV/all.xml.gz
- https://i.mjh.nz/SamsungTVPlus/all.xml.gz
- https://tvprofil.net/xmltv/data/epg_tvprofil.net.xml.gz
